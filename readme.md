# 🌐 Ray Marching Fractal Benchmark (Web)

This is a **web-based benchmarking tool** that uses **ray marching** to render a 3D fractal entirely in the browser. It features an **FPS/performance counter** and an **improved UI** for editing fractal parameters in real time.

## ✨ Features

- 📈 Real-time **FPS and performance stats**
- 🧩 Interactive UI to tweak fractal properties
- 🚀 GPU-accelerated ray marching using WebGL
- 📦 No install required — runs directly in your browser

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a WebGL-capable browser.
3. Use the on-screen UI to:
   - Adjust fractal parameters 
   - View real-time FPS/performance metrics
   - Pause or resume rendering


## 🙏 Credits & Inspiration

This project is inspired by [cznull](https://github.com/cznull/cznull.github.io), who laid the groundwork for WebGL-based fractal rendering.

My version builds on that work with:
- A responsive and cleaner UI for easier parameter tweaking
- Real-time FPS and performance metrics for benchmarking
- UI/UX improvements for better usability
